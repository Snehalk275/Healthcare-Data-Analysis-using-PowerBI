# Python EDA for Healthcare Data

This folder adds a Python & Pandas based exploratory data analysis
to the Power BI Healthcare Dashboard project.

It answers real business questions like:
- Which departments cause the longest wait times?
- Does long waiting reduce patient satisfaction?
- Which patient groups are least satisfied?
-Is hospital workload heavier in AM or PM?
-Which departments attract the most satisfied patients?

This Python analysis complements the Power BI dashboard
with data-driven insights for hospital operations.
